DLL Search Order
	Executables check the following locations (in successive order):
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
		The directory the the Application was run from
		The directory specified in in the C+ function GetSystemDirectory()
		The directory specified in the C+ function GetWindowsDirectory()
		The current directory



Windows Integrity Mechanism
	Integrity Levels
		Untrusted		Anonymous SID access tokens
		Low			Everyone SID access token (World)
		Medium			Authenticated Users
		High			Administrators
		System			System services (LocalSystem, LocalService, NetworkService)


User Account Control (UAC)
	Always Notify
	Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer
	Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop)
	Never notify
	
	Checking UAC Settings

		reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System



AutoElevate Executables
	Requested Execution Levels:
		asInvoker
		highestAvailable



Scheduled Tasks & Services
	Items to evaluate include:
		Write Permissions
		Non-Standard Locations
		Unquoted Executable Paths
		Vulnerabilities in Executables
		Permissions to Run As SYSTEM
		network connections
		
	Finding vulnerable Scheduled Tasks
		
		schtasks /query /fo LIST /v (Command Line)
		task scheduler (GUI)



DLL Hijacking
	Identify Vulnerability
	Take advantage of the default search order for DLLs
	NAME_NOT_FOUND present in executableâ€™s system calls
	Validate permissions
	Create and transfer Malicious DLL



SYNTAX
	services (GUI)
	look for evalutaed services from above
	If no description
		possible give away
	properties
		find at path to executable
		try to write to the directory it is in
		open up procmon.exe
			look for filters to identify dll's
				Process Name contains [executable]
				Path contains .dll
				Result is NAME NOT FOUND
			run [executable]
			look for a .dll to place a malicious .dll into
		IN LINUX
			msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /C "[command you want to run]" > C:\Users\student\Desktop\[command ran].txt' -f dll > SSPICLI.dll
